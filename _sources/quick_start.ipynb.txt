    "Basically there are several components that are exposed to users for building and configuring workflows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Task\n",
    "`Task` is the object represents the execution unit in your workflow. Tasks runs in parallel for different inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Flow\n",
    "`Flow` is the object that combines and records dependencies of all tasks you have put in. After it's been\n",
    "instantiated, it should be called for the actual dependency building and then can be executed by call `flow.execute()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Channel\n",
    "`Channel` represents a flow/queue of data, it's consumed by Tasks. Any user defined data should be\n",
    "enqueued into a channel and then as arguments of Task/Flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Operator\n",
    "`Operator` is built-in tasks that helps to manipulate the control of channels.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example: `map, sum, count, collect, flatten....`\n",
    "\n",
    "### A Typical workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "The workflow defined below covers most sets of features supported by pyflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: the output of the workflow may be different in different runs, this is\n",
    "due to the parallelism of task's executions for different inputs.\n"
